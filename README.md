## This repository is a work in progress

### Current goal: correlate state/federal higher ed financial support, by state, from the period 1990-present, relative to student enrollment by state from the same time period; identify relevant statistics and visualize in Tableau using map chart

From https://www.nasfaa.org/Financial_Aid_Data_Resources#3 

Since 1960, Grapevine has published annual compilations of data on state tax support for higher education, including general fund appropriations for universities, colleges, community colleges, and state higher education agencies. Each year's Grapevine survey has asked states for tax appropriations data for the new fiscal year and for revisions (if any) to data reported in previous years.

Convert tables to csv; choose tax appropriations or total fiscal support; visualize with data re: state populations and/or other metrics, and/or average college costs

For total enrollment stats by year: 
digest of education statistics https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/ 
*has fall enrollment broken down by state


shows increasing total costs (as does ipeds cost of attendance info, downloaded) 

compare with student default rates? By state?
