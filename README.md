Since 1960, Grapevine has published annual compilations of data on state tax support for higher education, including general fund appropriations for universities, colleges, community colleges, and state higher education agencies. Each year's Grapevine survey has asked states for tax appropriations data for the new fiscal year and for revisions (if any) to data reported in previous years.

Convert tables to csv; choose tax appropriations or total fiscal support; visualize with data re: state populations and/or other metrics, and/or average college costs

digest of education statistics https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/ 

shows increasing total costs (as does ipeds cost of attendance info, downloaded) 

compare with student default rates? By state?
